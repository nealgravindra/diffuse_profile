# diffuse_profile
How to diffuse a profile into a shared space for recommendations? Should we use supervised learning and feature attribution or variance metrics for perturbation profiles? How to evaluate this approach?

# Contributions

1. Diffusion vs. scoring network (dataset similarity metrics)
2. Feature attribution vs. raw or standardized perturbation profiles
3. Evaluation with prior knowledge
