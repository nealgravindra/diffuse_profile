# diffuse_profile
How to diffuse a profile into a shared space for recommendations? Should we use supervised learning and feature attribution or variance metrics for perturbation profiles? How to evaluate this approach?

# Contributions

1. Diffusion vs. scoring network (dataset similarity metrics)
2. Feature attribution vs. raw or standardized perturbation profiles
3. Evaluation with prior knowledge

[Liao et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0901-9) published a dataset of individuals' lung fluid with no, moderate, or severe/critical COVID-19. We have pre-processed that data and released the pre-processed version for this application. The pre-processed data is available here: . However, please visit the original manuscript for the data.
